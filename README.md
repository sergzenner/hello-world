# hello-world
Time-honored first repository.

I'm a total n00b, and I'm loving it! I've been an educator for many years, and all the adviced I ever spewed at my students is coming back to haunt me. Now it's my turn to brave through the discomfort of not knowing.
Currently, I am braving through not knowing Bash Scripting. It's pretty fun! Love making my computer meow at me on command.
